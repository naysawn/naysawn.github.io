  <p>I’ve learned that you need to be ok with upsetting people from time to time to if you are going to attempt to lead a movement.</p>

<p>On Friday, I accidentally published a <a href="http://www.artsumo.com/blog/post/4">blog post</a>, which discusses absurd paintings which have sold for over a million dollars on the Art Sumo blog. Although, I share a view that the art which caters to the rich is somewhat odd, I felt that the post could make me look silly and I did not want to ruffle too many feathers when launching <a href="http://www.artsumo.com">artsumo.com</a>, so I decided not to publish it.</p>

<p>Since publishing it, the post has gone on to make the digg homepage and garner the <a href="http://sharedcount.com/?url=http://www.artsumo.com/blog/post/4">most traffic</a> that artsumo has ever seen: about 50,000 visitors in the last 4 days, with over 500 shares between Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<p>I’ve found it particularly interesting that different discussion forums have very different takes on it.  <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5158036">Some can’t</a> find enough 4 letter words for me (I got an email that started with “whoever wrote this article is an artless cunt”), while <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/17o226/look_i_know_art_is_subjective_and_all_but_this_is/">other forums</a> completely agree with the spirit of the article.</p>

<p>I witnessed the same experience when I published a post sharing my view that <a href="http://naysawn.com/hey-entrepreneur-please-dont-get-an-mba/">entrepreneurs shouldn’t get an MBA</a>. Half loved it, it half loudly expressed their displeasure.</p>

<p>These experiences have taught me that any discussion which challenges the status quo will give a voice to a certain group of people, but will probably piss off a lot of people who don’t share your world view as well.  While it would be nice to get the former without the latter, I don’t think it is possible. So, from now on, I’m going to be embrace ruffling a few feathers.</p>
