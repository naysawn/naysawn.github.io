          <h2>Hacker News vs. Facebook &#8211; A Look At How Their Traffic Differs</h2>
<p class="meta">18 Oct 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I recently hit the Hacker News homepage for a post which discussed my favorite <a href="http://naysawn.com/my-favorite-start-up-chile-companies/">star</a><a href="http://naysawn.com/my-favorite-start-up-chile-companies/" title="My Favorite Start-up Chile Companies">tups from Start-up Chile</a>, it was on the homepage for a couple of hours.  I’ll break down how useful this traffic was below because to my surprise, while the post generated over 3700 visitors, only 10% of them viewed more than 1 page.</p>

<h3 id="the_traffic">The Traffic</h3>

<p>The spike from Hacker News sent in about 3700 visitors with the following breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li>1733 Visitors from <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a></li>

<li>659 Visitors from <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a></li>

<li>214 Visitors from <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a></li>

<li>113 Visitors from <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a></li>
</ul>

  This is the traffic to naysawn.com by hour:

<h3 id="but_only_10_of_visitors_viewed_more_than_1_page">BUT Only 10% of Visitors Viewed More Than 1 Page</h3>

<p>While the post generated a lot of traffic, 90% of the visitors bounced.</p>

<p>Here is the engagement breakdown from Google Analytics:</p>
<div class='wp-caption aligncenter' id='attachment_164' style='width: 610px'>
  <a href='http://naysawn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Engagement-by-Source.png'><img alt='Engagement Numbers' class='size-full wp-image-164' height='216' src='http://naysawn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Engagement-by-Source.png' title='Engagement Numbers' width='600' /></a><p class='wp-caption-text'>
    Google Analytics Reports That 90% Left Within 10s
  </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: After publishing this article, <a href="http://www.mouseandman.com/">Fred</a> correctly pointed out that Google Analytics reports <a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/2009/10/14/what-google-analytics-cant-tell-you-part-1/">users spent 0 seconds on the page</a> if they leave within a single page view.  Therefore this graph above is deceptive.  All that it shows is that 90% of users left the site within viewing a single page.</p>

<h3 id="engagement_differed_widely_by_source">Engagement Differed Widely By Source</h3>

<p>While Hacker News and Reddit sent the most traffic in terms of the percentage of the total traffic they sent, each was also more likely to have users only view a single page on the siter. I suspect this may be because people generally are opening less links when browsing Facebook and Twitter than when they are browsing Reddit or Hacker News.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reddit:</strong> 6.7% viewed more than 1 page</li>

<li><strong>Hacker News</strong>: 8.6% viewed more than 1 page</li>

<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> 11.7% viewed more than 1 page</li>

<li><strong>Facebook:</strong> 25.7% viewed more than 1 page</li>
</ul>

<p>Hacker News and Reddit nonetheless dwarfed Facebook and Twitter in the raw counts of users who viewed more than 1 page.</p>

    Reddit and Hacker News still sent the most users who viewed more than 1 page
  </p>
</div>
<h3 id="useful_but_not_incredible">Useful but Not Incredible</h3>

<p>Although <strong>only</strong> 6.7% of Reddit users and 8.6% of Hacker News read more than one page, they were still a great bunch. Many found the content compelling enough to sign up on the various start-ups, which were mentioned in the post, tweet it out or sign up on<a href="http://www.artsumo.com">Art Sumo</a>. This all came from just 300 visitors out of more than 3000 who first landed on the site.</p>
