I&#8217;ve learned that you need to be ok with upsetting people from time to time to if you are going to attempt to lead a movement.

On Friday, I accidentally published a [blog post][1], which discusses absurd paintings which have sold for over a million dollars on the Art Sumo blog. Although, I share a view that the art which caters to the rich is somewhat odd, I felt that the post could make me look silly and I did not want to ruffle too many feathers when launching [artsumo.com][2], so I decided not to publish it.

Since publishing it, the post has gone on to make the digg homepage and garner the [most traffic][3] that artsumo has ever seen: about 50,000 visitors in the last 4 days, with over 500 shares between Facebook and Twitter.

I&#8217;ve found it particularly interesting that different discussion forums have very different takes on it.  [Some can&#8217;t][4] find enough 4 letter words for me (I got an email that started with &#8220;whoever wrote this article is an artless cunt&#8221;), while [other forums][5] completely agree with the spirit of the article.

I witnessed the same experience when I published a post sharing my view that [entrepreneurs shouldn&#8217;t get an MBA][6]. Half loved it, it half loudly expressed their displeasure.

These experiences have taught me that any discussion which challenges the status quo will give a voice to a certain group of people, but will probably piss off a lot of people who don&#8217;t share your world view as well.  While it would be nice to get the former without the latter, I don&#8217;t think it is possible. So, from now on, I&#8217;m going to be embrace ruffling a few feathers.
